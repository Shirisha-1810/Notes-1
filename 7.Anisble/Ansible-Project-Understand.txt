=========================================================
TO integrate the anible control master with Jenkins. we follow the following
pre-requsites....

1.we need to setup the ACM with NODE.
	a. useradd  and passwd
	b. vi /etc/ssh/sshd.cnf---remove # for password auth, and passkey(nearly 2 places)
	c. vi /etc/sudoers ---add ansible all no passwd = all line at bottom.
	d.service sshd start

5. switching to ansible user
=======================================================

From ACM.

1. ssh-copyid node1ip
type ansible user password

2. ssh-copyid node2ip
type ansible user password

communication will happend between master and nodes.

sudo yum install -y ansible ( sudo amazon-linux-extras install ansible2 -y --->>>use this)
 

ansible --version

vi /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg 

#inventoryfile (remove comment)

vi /etc/ansible/hosts (node information)

####[webserver] -->> group (comments remove)

node1 ip (private Ip)

node2 ip (private Ip)

[databse]  -->>>group

:wq!


ansible all -m ping

=====================================================

su - ansible

6. ssh-keygen -t rsa

4 times enter (enter key press )

7. sudo service sshd restart



=======================================

follow all above commands. just follow the instalation and install ansible in ACM and make sure the connection of node is connected to ACM.

@2) step-2 is install tomcat from acm to be installed in node host,
  for this write a playbook for tomcat installation.

@3) step-3 is enter jenkins terminal similary connect to ansible machine as same procedure and write a play of copy.yml in ansible instance. 
@4) step-4 in jenkins use plugin publishoverssh and give the credentials and connect it and execute the command to run the job.
